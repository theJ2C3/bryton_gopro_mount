# bryton_gopro_mount
The metal version of gopro mount on bryton extension mount is a bit expensive

so i remix one with right size of screw hole

It is free to download it and print it 
The only other thing you would need is two m.2 flat head screw, a screw driver( it would be awesome to be a sonic screw driver but regular one works), and a set of gopro screw.
happy to help out.

P.S. It is suggested to print those gopro flat side horizontal to maximize the strenght of the output.
